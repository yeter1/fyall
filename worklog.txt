Things to do:


Day 1:

-Finish and organize HTML structure
     -Add a lobby
     -Ready button





Day 3:
     -Werewolf game should be irrelevant to clients
     -SERVER IS STORYTELLER
     -Server plays the werewolf game and communicates information between clients and the game, no need to send
     stuff from the game to the clients. all communication is held within server.js
     -Werewolf.js instead will send blurbs to the server of what turn it is, what needs to be prompted, etc.
     -Server.js DOES what werewolf decides (just as the storyteller follows the rulebook)




Day 4:

Hows the game going to work?
Possible bug --> 1 werewolf and 1 villager left?


//START =========================================================================
start game is called when everyone in the lobby is Ready

the clients are told to change the view to gameView and each user is given their Role

based on role, the seer(and eventually other roles) should be prompted about their night skills
     edit: where do these responses go?
          Well, for seer, it need not go anywhere. The client has sufficient information to tell that user if the person
          they wish to inspect is a werewolf or not

          NOTE: FOR EACH TURN, needs to be a "done Counter" so that the game waits for every player to Finish
          the available actions
          IF(doneCount == users.length) //Call day if Night, Call night if day

Solution: scaffold cycle (probably a name for this, its really basic, but I like scaffold cycle)
     Not reliant on time but instead the last user interaction of each "round"

     scaffold because....it looks like it with the crisscross pattern

     Server                   Client

     Send event
               \
                  \
                     \
                        \
                          \
                              receive event
                              do stuff
                              send event
                            /
                         /
                       /
                     /
                  /
     Receive event
     DO stuff
     wait for all users to respond
     check if game over
     record changes based on responses
     send event
                    --Repeat until win condition is met--


     TODO:
          1 ----nothing ----
          2 create win condition boolean function (DONE)
          3 create day/night cycle (similar to )

==================================================================================


Day 5:
     Processing of day lynch votes works on the server side

     TODO:
          1) Can submit vote without selecting a radio button
          2) put dialogue above vote in the div above it not prompt promptZone
          3) properly adjust the client side players list and listen/react to "day summary" emit
          4) make night work, like day but:
               a) werewolf chat?
               b) seer prompt?
               c) neither for villager?



Day 8:
	NOTE two major bugs: can vote for undefined on radio buttons, werewolfs have the option to night note werewolves, AND last vote did not work properly (could be a fluke, but 2/4 votes were for a and D got killed) 
	TODO: 
		1)change game.numWolfs to return the amount of ALIVE WEREWOLFS
		2) get night cycle working
