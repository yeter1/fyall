NOTE: obviously this is a lot, and the game would not look like this for a long time, if ever.
 But I figured I should write down my ideas while they're in my head and I have time

imo the storyteller is so perfect for being turned into server tasks because it then takes care of all the rules and tedious steps itself

this also allows us to host the server on a cloud service and make the game accesible anywhere and not have to worry about
 static IP's and all the typical internet issues that could arise

Without further ado, enjoy my brain dump

Werewolf-style game (mafia, etc, whatever you want to call it)

-Desktop application(Language -> Java? or something else, TBD)

-Use a GUI builder? lots of industry-standard ones these days

-Server should be autonomous, completely separate from any users, pretty sure we can host this with AWS or
 Google Cloud Services(which I can get free credit hours for via CS club)

-Storyteller IS the server, it is NOT a player
	- This opens up a HUGE possibility for customization/randomization/AI
		-Machine Learning Storyteller AI?
			-Makes Scenarios and a plot on its own based on examples we feed it

-Players log on, when at least X(the minimum) amount of players are in the lobby,
 users can ready up or wait for Y(the maximum) amount of players before starting

-Server assigns roles to each player, creates an introduction story 
	-Can have themes for each game(i.e. werewolfs are animorphs, vampires, etc.)
		-Icons and pictures for all themes (sounds like a Josh problem)
	-Setting for each game(can be random or fit to theme (transylvania, the future, narnia)
-The main gameplay takes place in a turn-based system mainly using a chat between all the players


Basic Turn ideology:

	1- Night time 
		1a)Special individual abilities are prompted to respectful role (prompts seer to pick another player)
		1b)The "werewolf"'s are given a separate chat in between turns to vote on who to kill
		1c) if you already used your ability/are a villager, user will see a waiting screen during this time
	2- Day time
		2a) server/storyteller gives the results of the night actions
		2b) chat between all players opens up
		2c) users are prompted to vote on who to kill
		2d) results are tallied and player with most votes dies
		2e) check for post-mortem abilities
